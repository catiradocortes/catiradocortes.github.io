The Metaverse has been rapidly expanding in content, form, and user engagement, yet there remains a critical gap in discussions regarding its impact on developing children. While consumer-grade Virtual Reality Head-Mounted Displays have made immersive experiences widely accessible, the question of whether and how young children should engage with these technologies remains largely unanswered. This position paper examines the inclusivity and developmental appropriateness of the Metaverse through the lenses of technology, human-computer interaction, and child psychology. Focusing on physical, cognitive, and socioemotional development, we identify key variables that shape children's interactions with virtual environments, including the display of virtual information, levels of immersion, and the vividness of virtual agents. We highlight both opportunities and risks, from the potential for enhanced learning and engagement to concerns about accessibility, safety, and developmental readiness. Additionally, we emphasize the need for adaptive design features that accommodate diverse abilities, ensuring an inclusive and equitable Metaverse experience for young users. Through this paper, we aim to initiate a broader conversation on how researchers, policymakers, and developers can work toward creating child-friendly digital spaces that balance innovation with developmental well-being. By addressing the unique needs of young children, we advocate for a Metaverse that is not only immersive but also safe, accessible, and developmentally appropriate.
