Although extreme wildland fires used to be rare events, their frequency has been increasing, and they are now causing enormous destruction. Therefore, understanding such fire events is crucial for global ecological and human communities. Predicting extreme fire events is an imperative yet challenging task. As these destructive events cannot be investigated via experimental field studies, physical modelling can be an alternative. This chapter explores the capability of fully physical fire models to simulate these events and the potential of integrating these simulations with advanced visualisation systems supported by machine learning. By presenting case studies and future directions, we emphasise the potential and necessity of this integration for improved fire management and policy making.
