This paper presents the preliminary results and lessons learned from developing a tablet as a touch-based interface within a 360-degree immersive environment to enhance firefighters' understanding of fire behavior. The tablet interface was developed through a User-Centered Design (UCD) and Design Thinking (DT) cycle to create a viscerally engaging experience. We evaluated the tablet with firefighter personnel. Our first results revealed that the tablet interface helped with situational awareness by providing context. Future efforts will focus on improving the UCD and DT cycles with more users, aiming to enhance the tablet to help develop immersive training modules that enhance firefighter preparedness and decision-making.
