The frequency of extreme wildfire events has increased in the past few years, causing large-scale damage. Increasing our understanding of the factors contributing to wildfire scale and magnitude is critical, especially for the fire response personnel. Pre-exposure to the dynamism of wildfire behaviour, or immersive sensemaking, is necessary to gain enough situational awareness to handle the risks of confronting them, leading to improved decision-making under high-risk, high-pressure conditions. We present the iFire Project, a full-body, AI-powered, immersive geo-visualisation system to improve firefighter understanding. The different modules of iFire combine to provide an augmented comprehension of wildfires.
