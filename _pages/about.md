I am a Lecturer in Interaction Design at the [Discipline of Design Lab](https://design.sydney.edu.au/), [Faculty of Architecture, Design & Planning](https://www.sydney.edu.au/architecture/), [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/). My research focuses on how we can explore complex ideas through Mixed Reality Technologies. My main research interests are immersive technologies, data visualization, and human-computer interaction. 

I hold a PhD in Software Engineering from the [University of Technology Sydney](https://www.uts.edu.au/), Australia, a Master's Degree in Computer Game Engineering from [Newcastle University](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/), UK, and a Bachelor's degree in Engineering and IT from [Monterrey Institute of Technology, Laguna Campus](https://tec.mx/en/laguna-campus), Mexico. I aim to contribute to developing effective visualization techniques in immersive technologies and advancing research and practical applications.

Before joining the University of Sydney, I had the opportunity to work with [Prof. CT Lin (University of Technology, Sydney)](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Chin-Teng.Lin), [Dr. Tim Chen (University of Adelaide)](https://ht-timchen.github.io/), [Dr. Thomas Do (THE BEST, University of Technology, Sydney)](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Thomas.Do), and [Prof. Dennis Del Favero (The University of New South Wales)](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/dennis-del-favero) across various research fields, including Human-Computer Interaction, Immersive Technologies, Data Visualization, Interaction Design, AI/ML, Brain-Computer Interfaces, and Visual Arts.
